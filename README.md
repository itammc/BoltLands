# Bolt-Lands Integration Plugin

This plugin integrates [Bolt](https://github.com/pop4959/Bolt) with [Lands](https://github.com/Angeschossen/LandsAPI), preventing the use of Bolt commands within Lands-protected areas unless the player is added as a member of the land.

## How It Works

- Players who are not members of a land cannot use Bolt commands inside the protected territory.
- If a player is added to the land, they will be able to use Bolt commands within that land's boundaries.

## Requirements

- [Bolt](https://github.com/pop4959/Bolt)
- [Lands](https://github.com/Angeschossen/LandsAPI)

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of the plugin.
2. Place the `.jar` file into your server's `plugins` folder.
3. Ensure that both the Bolt and Lands plugins are installed and configured.
4. Restart your server.

The plugin will start working automatically after installation.
